# AWS VPN Gateway Terraform module

Terraform module which creates [VPN gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_VPN.html) resources on AWS.

## Terraform versions

Terraform 0.12. Pin module version to `~> v2.0`. Submit pull-requests to `master` branch.

Terraform 0.11. Pin module version to `~> v1.0`. Submit pull-requests to `terraform011` branch.

## Features

This module creates:
* a [VPN Connection](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_connection.html) unless `create_vpn_connection = false`
* a [VPN Gateway Attachment](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_gateway_attachment.html)
* one or more [VPN Gateway Route Propagation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_gateway_route_propagation.html) depending on how many routing tables exists in a VPC
* one or more [VPN Connection Route](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_connection_route.html) if `create_vpn_connection = true` and `vpn_connection_static_routes_only = true`, and depending on the number of destinations provided in variable `vpn_connection_static_routes_destinations` (which must be inline with `vpc_subnet_route_table_count`)

This module does not create a [VPN Gateway](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpn_gateway.html) resource because it is meant to be used in combination with the [VPC module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws) that will create that resource (when `enable_vpn_gateway = true`).
This module also does not create a [Customer Gateway](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/customer_gateway.html) resource.
This module will create static routes for the VPN Connection if configured to create a VPN Connection resource with static routes and destinations for the routes have been provided.
The static routes will then be automatically propagated to the VPC subnet routing tables (provided in `private_route_table_ids`) once a VPN tunnel status is `UP`.
When static routes are disabled, the appliance behind the Customer Gateway needs to support BGP routing protocol in order for routes to be automatically discovered, and subsequently propagated to the VPC subnet routing tables.
This module supports optional parameters for tunnel inside cidr and preshared keys. They can be supplied individually, too.

## Usage

##### With [VPC module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws)

```hcl
module "vpn_gateway" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpn-gateway/aws"
  version = "~> 2.0"

  vpc_id                  = module.vpc.vpc_id
  vpn_gateway_id          = module.vpc.vgw_id
  customer_gateway_id     = aws_customer_gateway.main.id

  # precalculated length of module variable vpc_subnet_route_table_ids
  vpc_subnet_route_table_count = 3
  vpc_subnet_route_table_ids   = module.vpc.private_route_table_ids

  # tunnel inside cidr & preshared keys (optional)
  tunnel1_inside_cidr   = var.custom_tunnel1_inside_cidr
  tunnel2_inside_cidr   = var.custom_tunnel2_inside_cidr
  tunnel1_preshared_key = var.custom_tunnel1_preshared_key
  tunnel2_preshared_key = var.custom_tunnel2_preshared_key
}

resource "aws_customer_gateway" "main" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "172.83.124.10"
  type       = "ipsec.1"

  tags {
    Name = "main-customer-gateway"
  }
}

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 2.0"

  enable_vpn_gateway = true

  # ...
}
```

##### Without VPC module

```hcl
module "vpn_gateway" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpn-gateway/aws"
  version = "~> 2.0"

  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.vpn_gateway.id
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.main.id
  vpc_id              = aws_vpc.vpc.vpc_id

  vpc_subnet_route_table_count = 3
  vpc_subnet_route_table_ids   = ["rt-12322456", "rt-43433343", "rt-11223344"]

  # tunnel inside cidr & preshared keys (optional)
  tunnel1_inside_cidr   = var.custom_tunnel1_inside_cidr
  tunnel2_inside_cidr   = var.custom_tunnel2_inside_cidr
  tunnel1_preshared_key = var.custom_tunnel1_preshared_key
  tunnel2_preshared_key = var.custom_tunnel2_preshared_key
}

resource "aws_customer_gateway" "main" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "172.83.124.10"
  type       = "ipsec.1"

  tags {
    Name = "main-customer-gateway"
  }
}

resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
  # ...
}

resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "vpn_gateway" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.vpc_id

  # ...
}
```

## Examples

* [Complete example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpn-gateway/tree/master/examples/complete-vpn-gateway) shows how to create all VPN Gateway resources.
* [Complete example with static routes](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpn-gateway/tree/master/examples/complete-vpn-gateway-with-static-routes) shows how to create all VPN Gateway together with static routes.
* [Minimal example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpn-gateway/tree/master/examples/minimal-vpn-gateway) shows how to create just VPN Gateway using this module.
